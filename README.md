### Google Ads Import

|Document| Description|
| ----------- | ----------- |
|**Google Ads Import**<br/>[URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/guides/google-ads-import?view=bingads-13)&#124;[PDF](/docs/google-ads-import.pdf)|I wrote the Google Ads Import technical guide top to bottom. The program manager summarized our customer requirements and approved the final document with minor edits. Mockups of the UX components were also reviewed with the PM to inform the draft.|
|**AddImportJobs**<br/>[URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/campaign-management-service/addimportjobs?view=bingads-13)&#124;[PDF](/docs/addimportjobs.pdf)<br/><br/>**GoogleImportJob**<br/>[URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/campaign-management-service/googleimportjob?view=bingads-13)&#124;[PDF](/docs/googleimportjob.pdf)|These reference pages were developed together. I extended an internal application to generate the structure of all reference pages. From the starter template I wrote all content for the new Google Ads Import API feature. Content was reviewed by the product manager and developers.<br/><br/>Based on customer requirements the developers defined an initial set of APIs, and my proposed modifications were accepted for consistency with existing features.|
